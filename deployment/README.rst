Provisioning and configuring the hub
------------------------------------

For development and testing we provision a PINE64 board using an ubuntu base image that we then customize using ansible.

To download the base image use `make download-base`.

Then write the image to an SD card using your tool of choice (https://etcher.io/ seems like a fluffy choice for OSX).
