Git Access
==========

The git repository is hosted at `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_. We have a 'master' repository located at `github.com/getsenic/nuimo-hub-app <https://github.com/getsenic/nuimo-hub-app>`_ This master repository only contains the main branches (master, staging, release etc.)

If you don't already have a GitHub account, create a new one and add your public SSH key (you won't get access via HTTP), then fork the repository to your own account, i.e. like so::

    # git clone git@github.com:getsenic/nuimo-hub-app.git
    # cd nuimo-hub-app
    # git remote add XXX -f git@github.com:XXX/nuimo-hub-app 

(where `XXX` is, of course, your username on github).

Now you are ready to set up your local development environment and join the workflow, just read on!
